Mesa 3D Graphics Library

http://www.mesa3d.org/

This is an *unsupported* Mesa 5.1 binary for Win32,
with pure-software 3D rendering (compiled by VC++ 6.0).

For more details, license status, source code, etc.
refer to the Mesa website, but don't forget official
Mesa is distributed in source only form. This binary
is for your convenience only, and you use it at your
own risks, it is *not* supported by the Mesa project.

That said, the Win32 world is in need of dedicated
support for Mesa, if you feel up to the job and want
to help move this binary from "completely unsupported"
to "at least updated once in a while" (or better), 
feel free to join the Mesa project and contribute :)
